Hooking up the UI

Research:
Puredata: prior art, suggested by Prof. Shafae.

Goals:

1. Set up flask server to send user interface to web browser.

2. UI outstanding
    a. Fix network pane (non-interactive)
    b. Add Submit button
        To see if the docking library could handle multiple items, split the json editor panel into its own div, added a parent div, added some text, this didn't work - the layout code assumes one div I think and the editor bleeds into the pane below.

3. Connect user interface to server.
    a. Status
    b. Network
    c. JSON editor
    d. Render
