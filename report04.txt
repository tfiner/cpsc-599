Hooking up the UI

Research:
Puredata: prior art, suggested by Prof. Shafae.

Goals:

1. Set up flask server to send user interface to web browser.
    DONE!

2. UI outstanding
    a. Fix network pane (non-interactive)
        DONE!
    
    b. Add Submit button
        To see if the docking library could handle multiple items, split the json editor panel into its own div, added a parent div, added some text, this didn't work - the layout code assumes one div I think and the editor bleeds into the pane below.

    c. Add a way to get files in.
        DONE!  Drag and drop a JSON populates the editor and the network panes.

    d. Fix resize of network pane.
        There's one bug I know of outstanding: undocking clears the window.
        The Noise Tree inner window (cytoscape's) is being set to 0 dimensions.
        All other resize and docking works (I spelunked into the docking code to catch the events for dock/undock and suspend/resume of layout).

    e. Click on network node to edit JSON.
        DONE!

    f. Add the other JSON editor (code).

3. Connect user interface to server.
    a. Status

    b. Network
    c. JSON editor
    Done - both of these come from local files.

    d. Render
