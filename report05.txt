Suggestions from meeting:

Organize notes into different sections.
See if there's a way to compress the returned image.
    There is, the header of the XMLHttpRequest can include gzip.
    Flask-Compress does the deed.

From last report's TODOs:
    f. Add the other JSON editor (code).


DONE!  Add preview to a noise function.

Add CRUD to network window: Create, Read, Update, Delete.  
    Read is done.

    It is taking too long to get all the noise editor functionality in.  I've decided to disable the UI for that functionality and concentrate on the other items I need to get done. 


Started working with the panoramic viewer at http://www.dimin.net/software/panojs/.
Unfortunately, while the viewer itself has all the features I want (pan and zoom), it is sorely lacking in my API requirements:
must play well with others (little to no globals).  It is a collection of JS files that are littered with globals, including functions named things like "callback" that will surely clash with my other libraries and code.

Added tiled rendering.  I think this will be an enormous boost to interactivity.

TODO:
Fix image area selection so that the image selection actually works.
Start caching things.  JSON parsing is quick enough so that I'm not worried about passing those to each process.
