Independent Study Plan
Fall 2014
Tim Finer
Prof. Michael Shafae

Objective: Design and build a rendering application that will be the initial framework for rendering 3D landscapes.  The base renderer will be the ray tracer from CPSC-566.

Features to be implemented during this schedule:

    User Interface
    Scene editing via a syntax highlighting JSON editor widget
    The rest of libnoise added to the scene description language
    Graph of noise tree, with a context sensitive preview (click on a node, see result)


Bonus Features (if schedule allows):
    Progressive rendering preview
    Noise volume objects
    Light Scattering
    Ambient Occlusion
    Sky box

The schedule is 16 Weeks, broken up into 8, 2 week sprints.
